MusicSharp is a cross-platform Terminal User Interface (TUI) music player written in C# with the goal of being minimalistic and light on resources. An open source project, MusicSharp has received several contributors to the project who have helped implement features.  

For those who are interested, I've created [a project log](https://markjames.dev/2020-10-25-developing-a-cli-music-player-csharp/) to document the development process.
