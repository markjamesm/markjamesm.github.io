MusicSharp is a cross-platform Terminal User Interface (TUI) music player written in C# with the goal of being minimalistic and light on resources. Released as an open source project, MusicSharp has received several contributors to the project who have helped implement features.

In addition to working on MusicSharp, I've also created [a project log](https://markjames.dev/2020-10-25-developing-a-cli-music-player-csharp/) to document the development process.
