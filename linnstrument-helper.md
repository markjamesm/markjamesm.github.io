Linnstrument Helper is an [open source](https://github.com/markjamesm/linnstrument-helper) Mac OS app I'm actively developing to help people learn the Linnstrument layout quickly and efficiently. Just like a bass guitar, the Linnstrument uses [all fourths tuning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_fourths_tuning). Linnstrument Helper is still in a beta stage, and if you'd like to help contribute to the project, please take a look at the [issues page](https://github.com/markjamesm/linnstrument-helper/issues). For the curious, here's my [build log](https://markjames.dev/2020-05-06-writing-a-midi-controller-app-part-one/) for the project.

- Polyphonic sound engine
