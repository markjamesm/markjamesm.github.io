Linnstrument Helper is an [open source](https://github.com/markjamesm/linnstrument-helper) Mac OS app I'm actively developing to help people learn the [Linnstrument](https://www.rogerlinndesign.com/linnstrument) layout quickly and efficiently. Just like a bass guitar, the Linnstrument uses [all fourths tuning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_fourths_tuning). Linnstrument Helper is still in a beta stage, and if you'd like to help contribute to the project, please take a look at the [issues page](https://github.com/markjamesm/linnstrument-helper/issues).

## Features

- Basic polyphonic sound engine
- Displays current notes played along with velocity 
- Support for both the original model as well as the Linnstrument 128


## Binaries

- Binaries will be provided as soon as I finish mapping the notes to the Linnstrument 200 (the Linnstrument 128 board is currently fully supported). You can always build the project from the [repo](https://github.com/markjamesm/linnstrument-helper) however!
