Linnstrument Helper is an <a href="https://github.com/markjamesm/linnstrument-helper" target="_blank">open source</a> Mac OS app I developed to help people learn the <a href="https://www.rogerlinndesign.com/linnstrument" target="_blank">Linnstrument</a> layout quickly and efficiently. Just like a bass guitar, the Linnstrument uses all fourths tuning. If you'd like to help contribute to the project, please take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/markjamesm/linnstrument-helper" target="_blank">issues page</a>. 

For the curious, here's my [build log](https://markjames.dev/2020-05-06-writing-a-midi-controller-app-part-one/) for the project.

- Polyphonic sound engine.
- Displays note velocities, names, and locations on the Linnstrument (up to four notes max currently).
- Resizable grid elements.
- Compatible with both the full-size Linnstrument and Linnstrument 128 (USB MIDI).

## System Requirements
