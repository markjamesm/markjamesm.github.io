Linnstrument Helper is an [open source](https://github.com/markjamesm/linnstrument-helper) Mac OS app I'm actively developing to help people learn the [Linnstrument](https://www.rogerlinndesign.com/linnstrument) layout quickly and efficiently. Linnstrument Helper is still in an early alpha phase, and if you would like to help contribute to the project, please take a look at the [issues page](https://github.com/markjamesm/linnstrument-helper/issues).

## Features

- Basic polyphonic sound engine
- Displays current notes played along with velocity 
- Support for both the original model as well as the Linnstrument 128


## Binaries

- Linnstrument helper is still in a very early stage and binaries will be provided once the features hit a minimum threshold. You can always build the project from the [repo](https://github.com/markjamesm/linnstrument-helper) however!
