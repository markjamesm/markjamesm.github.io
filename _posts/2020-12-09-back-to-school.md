Its now been a little over half a decade since I graduated from McGill University with a BA in English Lit and a minor in Psychology. As I did my degree part-time (I had been working as a freelance web dev to pay for school), it took me half a decade before graduating. When I first graduated, I had no intention of returning to school anytime soon, but now the opportunity has presented itself and I'm ready to take the plunge!

Over the course of the pandemic, I've been working hard learning new skills and have been making great progress on several programming projects. Feeling increasingly confident in my development abilities, I saw an ad for a programming course at the University of Waterloo which piqued my interest. The course was only a one-off however, but it did get me to start looking around at various professional development programs, and that's when I discovered a fairly new <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/continuingstudies/professional-development-certificate-cloud-computing" target=_blank>Professional Development Certificate in Cloud Computing</a> offered by McGill University. Developed and taught by a Software Architect from Google, I fit the applicant profile well and was encouraged to apply after attending the information session a few weeks ago and was accepted into the program last week. Covering a total of five courses (each with 30 contact hours and minimum 30 hours of assignments), the program will take me a little over a year to complete (providing they offer spring/summer course options). 

Having experience with Linux server administration, the cloud has been something that I've been wanting to explore for quite some time now, but I've never really taken the plunge yet. However, with Covid expected to persist until the end of 2021, I feel like its a great time to continue developing new skills, and the certificate in cloud computing will be a feather in my cap once the pandemic ends (especially as more and more places look to shift towards the cloud).  

The first class begins at the end of January, and I'm both excited and a little nervous at the prospect of returning to school. This time however, I'm much more passionate about the subject matter and so I feel well positioned to do my best!
