title: On Pivoting
tags: [blog]

Roughly Three months ago, I applied to a cloud computing program at my alma mater (McGill University) which was developed and taught by a Software Architect from Google Cloud. I was accepted into the program early last month and wrote about my excitement in an [article from December](/2020-12-09-back-to-school/). Having been out of school for half a decade now, I was looking forward to going back and developing my skills in a range of cloud computing related topics including Cloud Architecture, Site Reliability Engineering, Docker, and Kubernetes.

Unfortunately this morning, three days before the start of the program, I received an email letting me know that the first course is cancelled due to lack of enrollment this semester. The news came as a bit of a shock, as although I understand the rationale for late cancellation (in case there are any last minute applicants), the information session held by the course creator in early December let us know that there were enough applicants for the course to proceed.

# The Road Ahead

Having spent seven years in the past self-employed as a Web Developer and Digital Marketer, I'm no stranger to pivoting. Based on my past experiences, the current situation presents both an unexpected challenge as well as an opportunity to continue my growth (providing that some important considerations are made beforehand). 

The cloud computing course will be offered again this Fall, but that's over half a year away with no guarantee that it won't be cancelled again, and so I don't see that as a viable option (unless September rolls around and I haven't started something new elsewhere). The University of Toronto also offers a cloud computing [certificate program](https://learn.utoronto.ca/programs-courses/certificates/cloud-computing) which starts tomorrow (it seems like I can register last minute!) and so I've been considering this route quite heavily. I do wish I could have participated in the information session to get a feel for the program beforehand however.

There's also the option of working towards cloud certification through one of the big three providers (AWS, Azure, and GCP), but the certification itself wouldn't provide some of the in-class learning experiences (with an actual Google Cloud Developer) that I was looking forward to. As we use Azure at work, I would likely lean towards that but would need to conduct more research with regards to what certifications are offered and which ones I should consider (something I had been hoping to evaluate while in the course).

# Mentorship Programs

As a big fan of lifelong learning, I've made it a point to learn functional programming in 2021, having settled on F# for [several reasons](/2021-01-04-why-learning-fsharp-2021/). I had been planning to integrate some of my newfound functional knowledge into the cloud space through the course of the program's exercises, but I'm also working on a side project in which I see F# being used fairly extensively if everything goes well. Not long ago, a tweet I posted received an interesting reply which led me to the [F# Mentorship Program](https://fsharp.org/mentorship/):

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">good luck. I&#39;m also planning on learning more basics about F# the latter half of this year after getting some prior projects out of the way. the <a href="https://t.co/3DavB4oGOm">https://t.co/3DavB4oGOm</a> mentor program motivated me when first getting started.</p>&mdash; J (@jlim1010) <a href="https://twitter.com/jlim1010/status/1351710073903587330?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 20, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Programming mentorships are something that I've been curious about for some time now, and the F# Foundation program looks great as I've had very positive experiences with the F# community so far on Slack and Discord. I planned to enroll as a mentee regardless of the cloud computing course, but unfortunately no new applications are being accepted for now. I'm hoping that they open up again sometime in 2021 as I really enjoy having discussions and working through some of the questions I have at times.

# Closing Thoughts

In my experience, unexpected pivots can be a hindrance in the short term, but they can also represent the beginnings of a new opportunity. I had originally gotten into web development when an employer I worked for part-time needed a website and I showed them a concept that caught their eye, and I later put myself through university by taking classes part time and working freelance for several clients who appreciated my work. 

In both of these situations, I recognized valuable opportunities for growth, and through hard work, dedication, and perseverance, I was able learn the skills I needed to consistently deliver high quality projects to my clients. 

One thing I definitely know, is that continuing to invest in education (whatever form that may take) is essential for both personal and professional development. I know that I'll bounce back from this setback and am excited to reassess my options going forward. If you have any anecdotes that you'd like to share regarding a similar situation, please let me know in the comments and don't hesitate to reach out and [contact me](/contact/)!
