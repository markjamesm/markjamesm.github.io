This page contains a list of some of my current and past projects. I haven't listed every project I've worked on, just some I think are of note.

## Ongoing

- [Linnstrument Helper](https://markjames.dev/linnstrument-helper), an open source Mac OS app I'm actively developing to help people learn the Linnstrument layout quickly and efficiently. In addition to the onscreen visual aids, I've also incorporated a basic synth engine with MIDI support. 

## Previous

- [CU Libraries](https://markjames.dev/cu-libraries), an open source iOS app written to check the status of various resources at the Concordia University libraries in Montréal, Canada. Built using realtime data sourced from the Concordia University Open Data API and now available on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/cu-libraries/id1500109652)! 

- [Bookmark Tester](https://github.com/markjamesm/bookmark-tester), a broken link checker designed to read HTML bookmark files from Chrome, Firefox, Chromium, and other browsers with an export to HTML feature. For those who are interested, I documented how I built this project in a [blog post here](https://markjames.dev/2020-04-20-bookmark-dead-link-checker-swift/).

- In 2019, I developed a new website for the [Interuniversity PhD in Art History Program](http://docinterhar.org) a joint PhD program run by Concordia University, Université de Montréal, and Université du Québec à Montréal. This involved regular meetings with the stakeholder throughout the development process to ensure that the functionality of the site aligned with the program's goals.
