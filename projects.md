This page contains a list of my current and past projects. I haven't listed every project I've worked on, just some I think are of note. If you're looking for my CV, check out my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/markjamesm/).

## Ongoing

- [CU Libraries](https://markjames.dev/cu-libraries), an open source iOS app to check the status of various resources at the Concordia University libraries in Montréal, Canada. Built using realtime data sourced from the Concordia University Open Data API. Now available on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/cu-libraries/id1500109652)!

- [Linnstrument Helper](https://markjames.dev/linnstrument-helper), a SwiftUI app for Mac OS to help make learning the Linnstrument layout a breeze. Currently in an an early alpha stage, Linnstrument Helper is being actively developed.


## Previous

- [Bookmark Tester](https://github.com/markjamesm/bookmark-tester), a broken link checker designed to read HTML bookmark files from Chrome, Firefox, Chromium, and other browsers with an export to HTML feature. For those who are interested, I documented how I built this project in a [blog post here](https://markjames.dev/2020-04-20-bookmark-dead-link-checker-swift/).

- In 2019, I developed a new website for the [Interuniversity PhD in Art History Program](http://docinterhar.org) run by Concordia University, Université de Montréal, and Université du Québec à Montréal. This involved regular meetings with the stakeholder throughout the development process to ensure that the functionality of the site aligned with the program's goals.
