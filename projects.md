This page contains a list of my current and past projects. I haven't listed every project I've worked on, just some I think are of note. If you're looking for my CV, check out my [Linkedin page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/markjamesm/).


## Current Projects

- [CU Libraries](https://github.com/markjamesm/CU-Libraries), an iOS app to check the status of various resources at the Concordia University libraries in Montréal, Canada. Built using realtime data sourced from the Concordia University Open Data API.  


## Past Projects

- In 2019, I created a new website for the [Interuniversity PhD in Art History Program](http://docinterhar.org) run by Concordia University, Université de Montréal, and Université du Québec à Montréal. This involved regular meetings with the stakeholder throughout the development process to ensure that the functionality of the site aligned with the program's goals.  

- I founded a highly popular herbal vaporizer reviews website called VaporBlog which I ran for six years before selling the website in 2018. Between 2012-2018, VaporBlog received over 3.4 million organic pageviews and began to generate consistent monthly income after the second month of launch.
