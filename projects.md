This page contains a list of my current and past projects. I haven't listed every project I've worked on, just some I think are of note. If you're looking for my CV, check out my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/markjamesm/).


## Current Projects

- [CU Libraries](https://markjames.dev/cu-libraries), an open source iOS app to check the status of various resources at the Concordia University libraries in Montréal, Canada. Built using realtime data sourced from the Concordia University Open Data API. Now available on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/cu-libraries/id1500109652)!

- [zSynth](https://github.com/markjamesm/ZSynth), a simple terminal based music synthsizer with support for MIDI controllers. Written in Swift using Audiokit as a proof of concept, I'm currently working on a new, more in depth version for iOS. 


## Past Projects

- In 2019, I developed a new website for the [Interuniversity PhD in Art History Program](http://docinterhar.org) run by Concordia University, Université de Montréal, and Université du Québec à Montréal. This involved regular meetings with the stakeholder throughout the development process to ensure that the functionality of the site aligned with the program's goals.
