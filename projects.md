This page contains a list of my current and past projects. I haven't listed every project I've worked on, just some I think are of note. If you're looking for my C.V, check out my [Linkedin page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/markjamesm/).


### Current Projects

- [CU Libraries](https://github.com/markjamesm/CU-Libraries) is an iOS app to check the status of various resources at the Concordia University libraries. Built using the Concordia Open Data API.


### Past Projects

#### Interuniversity PhD in Art history

In 2019, I created a new website for the [Interuniversity PhD in Art history program](http://docinterhar.org) run by Concordia University, Université de Montréal, and Université du Québec à Montréal. This involved regular meetings with the stakeholder throughout the development process to ensure that the functionality of the site aligned with the program's goals.  

- Oversaw the project's development to completion, managing small team using an agile methodology.


#### VaporBlog

I founded a highly popular vaporizer reviews website which I ran for six years before selling the website in 2018. 

-Between 2012-2018, VaporBlog received over 3.4 million organic pageviews and began to generate consistent monthly income after the second month of launch.
