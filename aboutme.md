### Fun fact

I'm passionate about music and release tracks under the name [Zhund](https://open.spotify.com/artist/04h01WGkLNuHzSzCBGbjCR). My favorite instrument is the [Linnstrument](http://linnstrument.com), an expressive MIDI controller created by the legendary Roger Linn. Here's a clip of me playing some improv jazz on Linnstrument:
