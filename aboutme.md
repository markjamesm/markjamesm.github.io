## Fun fact

I'm passionate about music and release tracks under the name <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/04h01WGkLNuHzSzCBGbjCR">Zhund</a>. My favorite instrument is the <a href="http://linnstrument.com">Linnstrument</a>, an expressive MIDI controller created by the legendary Roger Linn. Here's a clip of me playing some improv jazz on Linnstrument:
